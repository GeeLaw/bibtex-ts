# BibTeX-TS

To import the library, put the generated `/lib/bibtex.js` file somewhere and `const BibTeX = require('path/to/bibtex.js')`. The basic idea is that any publicly available classes and functions are consumable from JavaScript and should resist malformed input. Private constructions are available in `BibTeX._Privates` (as well as `obj._Privates` and `obj._MutablePrivates` for objects with private fields).

User familiar with the BST language can find a quick chart in [`BST.md`](BST.md).

## Methods

There are 4 methods available under `BibTeX` object.

- `ParseLiteral` parses a string into a `Strings.Literal` object by returning a `Strings.ParseLiteralResult` object. Inspect the returned object to see whether an error occurred and get the result.
- `ParseDatabase` parses the content of a `.bib` file and returns a `ObjectModel.ParseDatabaseResult` object. Inspect it to get the result.
- `ParsePersonNames` parses a `Strings.Literal` object into an array of `ObjectModel.PersonName`.
- `ParsePersonNameFormat` parses a `string` into an `ObjectModel.PersonNameFormat` object.

## `Strings` namespace

This namespace contains the string model used in BibTeX-TS. It has 3 classes representing fragments of strings, called *pieces*:

- `BasicPiece` represents a fragment of string that is outside braces and contains no braces.
- `SpCharPiece` represents a fragment of string that is considered a *special character*. It is a fragment that begins with `{\` and has balanced braces.
- `BracedPiece` represents a fragment of string enclosed in braces but that is not a special character. It is a fragment that begins with `{` not followed by `\` and has balanced braces.

For example, the string `{\relax Ch}ristopher learnt how to use {{\LaTeX}}.` consists of 4 pieces:

1. `{\relax Ch}` is a `SpCharPiece`. Its *value* is the fragment with the first and last braces removed, i.e, `\relax Ch`.
2. `ristopher learnt how to use ` is a `BasicPiece`. Its value is the fragment itself.
3. `{{\LaTeX}}` is a `BracedPiece`. Its value is the fragment with the first and last braces removed, i.e., `{\LaTeX}`.
4. `.` is another `BasicPiece`.

Pieces can be constructed using their corresponding constructors that accepts the desired *value* (not the fragment itself!). Each class also has its `Empty` static property that stores a canonical empty instance. Note that, however, an empty `SpCharPiece` is actually `{\relax}`, where `\relax` is the LaTeX command that does nothing.

Strings are represented using the `Literal` class. Such an instance can be constructed from the array of its pieces. The following properties are the most important:

- `Raw` stores a string that can be parsed into the equivalent `Literal` instance using `BibTeX.ParseLiteral`.
- `Pieces` provides access to individual pieces. It is guaranteed that the pieces will not have empty `BasicPiece`s nor consecutive `BasicPiece`s.

`Literal` also has a static `Empty` storing a canonical empty instance.

## `ObjectModel` namespace

This namespace contains several classes. Generally, instances of those classes should be parsed and not created by consumers.

`StringRef` and `StringExpr` represent string operation in `.bib` database file. A `StringExpr` consists of several summands, each of which is either a `Literal` or a `StringRef`. For example, `author = {A} # and # "B"` will be parsed into an `EntryData`, whose `Fields.author` is a `StringExpr` consisting of 3 summands, the first and the third being `Literal`s and the second being a `StringRef` to `and` (which is supposed to be defined by a `@string` command).

`Entry` and `EntryData` represent resolved/unresolved entry. By parsing a `.bib` file, you get several `EntryData` instances. By calling the `Resolve` method, you get the `Entry` of that `EntryData`. The difference is whether `Fields` contain `StringExpr`s or `Literal`s.

`BibTeX.ParseDatabase` returns its results as a `ParseDatabaseResult` object, from where you can inspect errors and results. The errors are represented as `ParseDatabaseError` objects. This means all errors will be reported (as opposed to all other parsing methods where only the first error is reported).

`PersonName` represents a name. This is a BST language concept. Names are parsed from `Literal`, where each name is separated by the word `and` surrounded by whitespace. Each name can take the form `First von Last` or `von Last, First` or `von Last, Jr, First`. The `PersonName` object stores the words of each part of the name as well as the separators between consecutive words. Use `BibTeX.ParsePersonName` to obtain instances of this class. For each name, the first error in parsing that name is reported.

`PersonNameFormatComponent` represents a name component in a name format. It's included in the public visible part mainly for `instanceof` testing.

`PersonNameFormat` is a reusable name format object. Use `BibTeX.ParsePersonNameFormat` to obtain an instance. Use `PersonNameFormat.Format` method to format a `PersonName`. See the following example:

```JavaScript
const BibTeX = require('./bibtex.js');
const fmt = '{f. }{vv }{ll}';
const format = BibTeX.ParsePersonNameFormat(fmt);
const name = BibTeX.ParsePersonName(BibTeX.ParseLiteral('Jean-Baptiste de La Salle').Result)[0];
// J.-B. de La~Salle
console.log(format.Format(name));
// (same)
console.log(name.Format(fmt));
```

The advantage of using a `PersonNameFormat` object is efficiency. Each time `PersonName.Format` is called, the string needs to be parsed. If the same format is used for many names, parse the format string into a `PersonNameFormat` and use `PersonNameFormat.Format`.

## `TeX` namespace

This namespace has one abstract class `SimpleHandler`. It is a sufficient template to handle most TeX rendering you need in a `.bib` file. A handler can be created by deriving the class and implementing `EatXxx` methods and `Finish` method.

The `TextRenderer` class is an example of how to use `SimpleHandler`. It implements a basic TeX to plain text converter that handles many (La)TeX commands. The handler does not handle equations (it recognizes them so that it can keep them intact). The handler is rather involved in handling diacritical marks, because it has to keep track of the first letter (grapheme) so that it attaches the diacritical mark to the correct position. For example, `\'{\^a}` should yield `a` with a hat above it, with acute accent, whereas `\^{\'a}` yields `a` with acute accent, with a hat above it. It would be incorrect to "simply insert the diacritical mark after the first Unicode codepoint in the string rendered by its first argument".
